#### ClimeSage | Weather App | Open Weather Api | Retrofit & Kotlin Coroutines


#### API Call is 5 Days/3 hours Forecast


1. Search Weather By Current Location

2. Search Weather By City


###### For today's forecast I get the system's current date and filter out the objects that contain the weather of today and store them in a today's weather list 

###### If the timestamp in today's forecast list matches or is the nearest to curernt time then I display that weather object as current weather
